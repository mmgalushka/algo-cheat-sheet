```

## What it is for?

Many of us working in the software development industry had grilling technical interviews, where we had been asked to solve various technical problems. The majority of these problems have well-defined algorithmic solutions. The challenge is to identify the relevant algorithm, apply it to the specific problem, and compute the complexity of the obtained solution. This cheat sheet provides a summary of the most common algorithms and data structures you might use during an interview (or maybe also in your work).

## How to use it?

This project contains just two files: [algo-n-ds.docx](algo-n-ds.docx) and [algo-n-ds.pdf](algo-n-ds.pdf), The **algo-n-ds.docx** is an editable source, feel free to modify it and correct any inconsistencies. The **algo-n-ds.pdf** is the PDF version of the cheat sheet, download it and place some were close, so it is convenient to use :wink:.

**Note:** Due to the compatibility issues **algo-n-ds.docx** contains some distorted color and formulas definitions compare to the original Word version. Because of this, you might observe some misalignments between **algo-n-ds.docx** and **algo-n-ds.pdf** files.
